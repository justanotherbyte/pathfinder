# Pathfinder

Pathfinder is a blind* rover. It's just equipped with an ultrasonic distance sensor. My goal with pathfinder is to develop a rover that can navigate complicated spaces on its own just with distance data by assembling a rough model of the room its in.

It'll also have a manual controller to control pathfinder yourself. Currently there aren't any plans to make it customisable but feel free to fork it and make the appropriate changes yourself.

### Blog

I have a little post I'm writing up about this project and all its granular details in the `blog.md` file which you can find in the root of the project's directory. It'll be posted on [my website](https://justanotherbyte.me) when I deem that its in a good enough state to be published.
